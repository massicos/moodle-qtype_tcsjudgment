      | id_fraction_2              | 3                                  |
      | id_fraction_3              |                                    |
      | id_feedback_0              | Feedback for answer 1              |
      | id_feedback_1              | Feedback for answer 2              |
      | id_feedback_2              | Feedback for answer 3              |
